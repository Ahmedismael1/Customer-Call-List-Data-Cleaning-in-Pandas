# Customer-Call-List-Data-Cleaning-in-Pandas

## This Python script demonstrates how to clean and pre-process a customer call list dataset using Pandas library. It covers common data cleaning tasks such as:

- Handling missing values: Identify and handle missing values in various columns, such as imputing missing values, dropping rows with too many missing values, or using alternative strategies like mean/median 
  imputation.
- Data type correction: Convert data types to appropriate formats, such as converting strings to numeric values for calculations or changing date/time formats for consistent analysis.
- Data standardization: Address inconsistencies in data format or representation, such as standardizing names, handling duplicate entries, and ensuring consistent formatting across columns.
- Outlier detection and correction: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset that may skew the analysis, using techniques like Z-score or interquartile range (IQR) methods.
- Data validation: Ensure data integrity and consistency by applying checks for specific conditions or logical constraints, such as phone number format validation or date range verification.

## Benefits:

- Improves the quality and accuracy of your data analysis.
- Reduces the risk of errors and biases in your results.
- Prepares your data for building machine learning models or performing statistical analysis.
- Makes your data more organized and easier to work with.

## Requirements:
Python 3.x
Pandas library

## The script will be divided into sections:

1) Import libraries and load data: Importing Pandas and reading the customer call list data into a DataFrame object.
2) Missing value analysis and handling: Analyzing missing values in each column and applying appropriate strategies to handle them.
3) Data type correction: Checking and correcting data types for consistency and analysis suitability.
4) Data standardization: Standardizing data formats, addressing inconsistencies, and handling duplicate entries.
5) Outlier detection and correction: Identifying and handling outliers in the data to improve data quality.
6) Data validation: Implementing data checks to ensure consistency and integrity.
7) Output cleaned data: Saving the cleaned and pre-processed data for further analysis.

## Target Audience:

- Data analysts and scientists
- Business analysts
- Anyone working with customer data
